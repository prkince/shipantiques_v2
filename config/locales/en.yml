        <h3>LCL/FCL maritime transport</h3>
        <p>All merchandise that is shipped by SHIP ANTIQUES via maritime freight will be packed in crates. It is a fundamental condition that allows us to limit or even eliminate any risks of damage during the transport.</p>
        <p>FCL - Full container</p>
          <li>The most economical solution for dispatching large volumes.</li>
          <li>We can offer 20' (about 25 m3) and 40'  (55 m3) dry or High Cube containers.</li>
          <li>Our own teams load the objects into the container  which ensures that the crates are correctly locked in place and secured.</li>
        <br>
        <p>LCL - Shared containers</p>
          <li>Shared container with the merchandise of other customers.</li>

        <h3>Air freight and express deliveries</h3>
        <p>Air freight</p>
          <li>Fast and safer, air freight is recommended for sending small volumes as well as fragile and valuable objects.</li>
          <li>We propose air freight via cargo or commercial flights depending on the size of the crates. We prefer using direct flights in order to reduce the risk of damage due to the unloading and reloading in intermediate airports.</li>
          <br>
        <p>Express delivery</p>
          <li>Express delivery, such as via FedEx or DHL, is recommended for small volumes with low value and has the advantage of a 'door to door' service. It also avoids the need on the destination site for a transport agent for Customs formalities.
          </li>
          <li>Attention : This kind of transport is not suitable for dispatching any type of object. For example, it cannot meet the specific formalities needed for sending items that require cultural passports, export licenses or CITES documentation etc...

          </li>
          <br>
        <p>International</p>
          <li>We can either charter entire trucks or use bulk transport facilities for deliveries throughout Europe. In this case, the merchandise will be packed in crates in order to guarantee the safety and security.
          </li>
          <br>
        <p>Switzerland bulk freight.</p>
          <li>We regularly arrange bulk freight to Switzerland as well as to border countries around France. In this case, it is not always necessary to go to the expense of packing the items in a crate because we can sufficiently wrap and protect them with suitable material. There are some exceptions, such as chandeliers, that need the extra protection of a crate.
